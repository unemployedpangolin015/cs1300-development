### Goal and Value of the Application
The goal of the application is to allow users to browse various Pokemon, learn about their types and HP, and favorite Pokemon that they are interested in. Users can filter Pokemon by type and sort the Pokemon alphabetically and by HP. Users can also view the Pokemon they have favorited, and view the sum of the total HP. 

The value of this application is that it allows users interested in Pokemon to learn more each Pokemon's stats and save the Pokemon they are interested in. 

### Usability Principles Considered
#### Layout
I tried to make the layout similar to commonly used online shopping interfaces, so that it fits with the user's mental model. Consequently, I created a side bar that allows users to sort and filter, as well as view the favorites. 

#### Hierarchy
I created cards for each Pokemon in a grid layout. Because users are visuals, I put the image first on the card and made it large. I bolded the Pokemon name and made it the largest text on the card so that the users know it is important information. I put the different types that the Pokemon had in badges on the card, color coded the types, and added an icon for each type. I also put the "Add to Favorites" button on the bottom and put it in a bright blue color, so users know it should be clicked.
